# Project3_Coursera_R
run_analysis.R is a R script that does the following:
- merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
- extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- labels the data set with descriptive variable names
- creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
